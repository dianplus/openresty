# Project Rules Index

This file serves as the main entry point for AI coding assistants. For detailed rules, see the corresponding `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`:

**Note**: This project uses the modern Cursor `.cursor/rules/` system. The deprecated `.cursorrules` file has been removed.

- **01 · Python Fundamentals**: `.cursor/rules/01-python-basics.mdc`
  - Core Python typing rules, Pydantic usage basics, and annotation requirements.
- **02 · FastAPI & Pydantic Schema**: `.cursor/rules/02-fastapi-schema.mdc`
  - Detailed schema design guidelines, request/response separation, and validation rules for FastAPI services.

Add new `.mdc` files to `.cursor/rules/` and reference them here when additional rule sets are introduced.
